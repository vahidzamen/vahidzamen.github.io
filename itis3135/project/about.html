    <section class="card">
      <p>
        Nxt Step Auto Boutique started as a passion project built around cars, community, and craftsmanship.
        From late-night driveway details to full studio builds, we treat every vehicle like it’s our own.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our focus is simple: clean installs, honest recommendations, and long-term relationships with clients
        who love their cars as much as we do.
