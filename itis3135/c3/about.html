      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        C3 exists to bring car enthusiasts together in a positive way. We encourage safe
        driving, respect for others, and a welcoming space for people who are new to
        cars.
      </p>
      <p>
        The club mixes casual social events with simple learning activities, like basic
        maintenance days and photo walks.

      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <div class="hero">
        <div class="hero-text">
          <p>
            Our members are a mix of engineering students, business majors, commuters,
            and dorm residents. Some wrench on their cars every weekend. Others just
            enjoy looking at builds and talking about future projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            C3 works with other campus groups for charity events and shared meets to show
            that car culture can be safe, kind, and fun.
