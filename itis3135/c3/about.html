        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          The 49ers Car Culture Club (C3) exists to bring together UNC Charlotte students who share
          a love of cars, whether that means drifting, detailing, engineering, or photography.
        </p>
        <p>
          We focus on community, safety, and respect—no ego, no gatekeeping. C3 is a place where
          someone with their first car can park next to a fully built project and feel equally welcome.
        </p>

          <h2>Who We Are</h2>
          <p>
            We’re a mix of engineering students, designers, business majors, commuters, and dorm
            residents. Some members wrench on their cars every weekend; others just love going to
            meets and talking about dream builds.
          </p>
          <p>
            C3 collaborates with other campus organizations for charity cruises, workshops, and
            social events, helping show that car culture can be positive, safe, and inclusive.
