          <p class="lead">
            The 49ers Car Culture Club is a friendly place for car fans of all kinds. It does not
            matter if you daily a stock commuter, have a full build, or just like looking at cars —
            everyone is welcome.
          </p>
          <p>
            We host meets, cruises, workshops, and photo days during the semester. Check the Events
            page for dates and times, then come hang out with other people who get just as excited
            about cars as you do.
          </p>

        <h2>What is C3?</h2>
        <p>
          C3 is built around six simple questions: <strong>who, what, where, when, why, and how.</strong>
          Together, they explain what our club is all about.
        </p>

          <!-- WHO -->
          <article class="mini-card">
            <h3>Who</h3>
            <p>
              UNC Charlotte students, alumni, and friends who enjoy cars and car culture — from
              daily drivers to full builds.
            </p>
          </article>

          <!-- WHAT -->

            <h3>What</h3>
            <p>
              Casual meets, cruises, tech nights, simple maintenance workshops, and plenty of time
              to talk cars.
            </p>
          </article>

          <!-- WHERE -->
          <article class="mini-card">
            <h3>Where</h3>
            <p>
              Mostly on campus near the Student Union and CRI Deck, plus local photo spots around
              Charlotte.
            </p>
          </article>

          <!-- WHEN -->
          <article class="mini-card">
            <h3>When</h3>
            <p>
              We aim for at least one event per month during the fall and spring semesters, with
              extra meets when the weather is nice.
            </p>
          </article>

          <!-- WHY -->
          <article class="mini-card">
            <h3>Why</h3>
            <p>
              To build a safe, relaxed community around cars and driving — no ego, no pressure,
              just people who love cars.
            </p>
          </article>

          <!-- HOW -->
