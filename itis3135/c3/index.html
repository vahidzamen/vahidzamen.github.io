            The 49ers Car Culture Club is a friendly place for car fans of all kinds. It does not
            matter if you daily a stock commuter, have a full build, or just like looking at cars —
            everyone is welcome.
          </p>
          <p>
            We host meets, cruises, workshops, and photo days during the semester. Check the Events
            page for dates and times, then come hang out with other people who get just as excited
            about cars as you do.

        <h2>What is C3?</h2>
        <p>
          C3 is built around six simple questions: <strong>who, what, where, when, why, and how.</strong>
          Together, they explain what our club is all about.
