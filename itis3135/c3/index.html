        <h2>Welcome to C3</h2>
        <p>
          The 49ers Car Culture Club is a friendly place for car fans of all kinds.
          It does not matter if you daily a stock commuter, have a full build, or just like
          looking at cars — everyone is welcome.
        </p>
        <p>
          We host meets, cruises, workshops, and photo days during the semester.
          Check the Events page for dates and times, then come hang out with other people who
          get just as excited about cars as you do.

      <h2>What is C3?</h2>
      <p>
        C3 is built around six simple questions: <strong>who, what, where, when, why,</strong> and
        <strong>how</strong>. Together, they explain what our club is all about.
      </p>

      <h3>Who</h3>
      <p>UNC Charlotte students, alumni, and friends who enjoy cars and car culture.</p>

      <h3>What</h3>
      <p>Casual meets, cruises, tech nights, maintenance workshops, and photo days.</p>

      <h3>Where</h3>

      <h3>When</h3>
