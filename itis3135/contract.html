    <h2>Course Contract</h2>

    <p>
      I, <a href="introduction.html">Vahid Zamen</a>, agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my
      <strong>Fall 2025, ITIS-3135</strong> class with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.
    </p>

    <p>
      I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world,
      and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
    </p>

    <p>
      I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class.
      As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
    </p>

    <p>
      I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find many examples online,
      even view my classmates’ code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut
      and paste code except where I have properly given credit (i.e., external libraries) and never from my classmates.
    </p>
